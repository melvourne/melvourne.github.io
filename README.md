OVERVIEW

I want to create a portfolio website that is minimalist and showcases clean and intuitive design. It should be fun with
some sleek animation and at the same time very engaging to the user.

INSPIRATION

There are so many beautiful websites out there and I find it quite motivating but also overwhelming to decide which designs to incorporate
in my website. One great resource for checking out wonderfully designed websites is awwards.com. I was really drawn to Material
design made by Google that uses layers, flat icons and ui colours.  

PROCESS

Wireframe
I use Figma to do the wireframe of the website. Never have I used such tool before but it's simple enough that you just have
to play around to get the hang of it. Here's my figma wireframe design. https://www.figma.com/file/YjIfmQmOPn3NxuDD1IGRtqsy/Final-Wireframe
