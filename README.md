OVERVIEW

I want to create a portfolio website that is minimalist and showcases clean and intuitive design. It should be fun with
some sleek animation and at the same time very engaging to the user.

INSPIRATION

There are so many beautiful websites out there and I find it quite motivating but also overwhelming to decide which designs to incorporate
in my website. One great resource for checking out wonderfully designed websites is awwards.com. I was really drawn to Material
design made by Google that uses layers, flat icons and ui colours.  

PROCESS

Wireframe
I use Figma to do the wireframe of the website. Never have I used such tool before but it's simple enough that you just have
to play around to get the hang of it. Here's my figma wireframe design. https://www.figma.com/file/YjIfmQmOPn3NxuDD1IGRtqsy/Final-Wireframe

Coding
The layout of my website is pretty simple. I just have to make sure the alignments of the content are evenly spaced out and have a good flow. I put the contents in each different sections.

LEARNINGS
This is my very first website so it comes with a lot of challenges. I spent quite some time figuring out the layout and spacing of the content to make it more appealing. I also have to make sure that the animations dont affect the functionality of the website.
